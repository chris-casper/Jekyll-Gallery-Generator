# Jekyll-Gallery-Generator

## Origin Story
I've been taking photos for years, so have quite a few folders of photos. Rather than making dozens of markdown files, I wrote a short shell script to do the hard slog for me. I used a template markdown file, which is copied and the folder name inserted in a couple places. Thankfully it worked out quite well.
